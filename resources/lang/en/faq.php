Without more information about your specific situation, it is impossible to determine the exact amount that may cost you. What we can say with certainty is that if you are a member of Defa\'a, you will save significantly compared to directly hiring an attorney. The best way to know the cost is to purchase a plan that suits your needs, talk to the platform team, and they can inform you about the costs.
